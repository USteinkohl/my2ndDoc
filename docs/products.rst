**Computer-on-Modules are a core competence of Ka-Ro electronics**

The TX embedded module integrates all the core components of a common PC and is mounted 
onto an application specific carrier board. TX modules have a standardized form factor 
of 67,6mm x 26mm, have specified pinouts and provide the functional requirements for an 
embedded application. These functions include, but are not limited to, graphics, network 
and multiple USB ports. A single ruggedized SO-DIMM connector provides the carrier board 
interface to carry all the I/O signals to and from the TX module. This SO-DIMM connector is 
a well known and proven high speed signal interface connector that is commonly used for memory 
cards in notebooks

Carrier board designers can utilize as little or as many of the I/O interfaces as deemed necessary. The carrier board 
can therefore provide all the interface connectors required to attach the system to the application specific peripherals. 
This versatility allows the designer to create a dense and optimized package, which results in a more reliable product while 
simplifying system integration. Most importantly, TX applications are scalable, which means once a product has been developed, 
the product range can be diversified by using TX modules with a different performance class. Simply unplug one module and replace 
it with another, no redesign is necessary.
